FULL NAME: Christian Agyapong, known professionally as Chrix Tech.
LOCATION: Currently living and studying in Accra, Ghana.

WHO I AM:
I am Christian Agyapong — an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Full Stack Developer, and researcher.
I go by Chrix Tech professionally. I am based in Accra, Ghana, and I genuinely love what I do.
My work sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and practical software engineering.
I design systems from the ground up, wire together ML models, build APIs, craft frontends, and deploy to the cloud.
I bridge the gap between research ideas and real working products.

EDUCATION:
High School (Senior High School): Achimota School (Mar 2021 – Sep 2023), High School Diploma – General Arts.

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Ghana, Legon.
My major is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
Expected university completion: October 2027.

My coursework and self-study cover algorithms, data structures, probability theory, linear algebra,
neural networks, deep learning architectures, transformer models, and software engineering principles.
I believe you only truly understand something when you have built it yourself, so I balance theory with building.


TECH STACK AND SKILLS:
Programming languages: Python (primary), JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS.
Frontend and mobile: React (web), Next.js, React Native (mobile apps), Tailwind CSS, Responsive Design.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, FastAPI, REST API design, Database Design, Authentication Systems.
Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase Firestore, Supabase.
Cloud and deployment: Firebase, Google Cloud, AWS, Docker, Vercel, Fly.io, GitHub.
AI and ML: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI Agents,
Prompt Engineering, NLP, Computer Vision, Model Fine-tuning, Transformer Models.
AI Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, LangGraph,
OpenAI API, Gemini API.
Design: Figma, UI/UX Design, Graphic Design, Prototyping.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:
1. AI Engineer at ScaleUpBuild:
   I developed AI-powered business automation solutions, built RAG systems so businesses could query
   their own documents intelligently, integrated AI assistants into existing workflows, and designed
   LLM-powered customer support solutions.

2. Machine Learning Intern at DISAL — Digital Health Solutions (September 2025 – December 2025):
   I worked on healthcare AI with a focus on African patients. A key project used MedGemma for skin
   disease detection. I prepared medical image datasets, trained and evaluated ML models, and tackled
   the challenge of African patient underrepresentation in medical AI datasets.
   This work matters to me because AI that only works for certain populations is not equitable AI.

3. UI/UX Designer and QA Tester at King Of Glory Covenant Chapel International:
   I designed interfaces for a church management system, created wireframes and prototypes,
   conducted usability testing, and built a responsive design system.

4. Full Stack Developer at DigitalWave Technologies:
   I built full-stack web applications — frontend, backend APIs, database schemas, and scalable deployments.

PROJECTS I HAVE BUILT:
1. AI WhatsApp Business Assistant (RAG / Generative AI):
   A RAG system giving businesses an intelligent WhatsApp assistant powered by their own documents.
   It uses semantic search so answers are grounded in real business data, not hallucinated.
   It has conversation memory so the assistant recalls earlier parts of a chat.
   Stack: Python, LLMs, LangGraph, Vector Database, PostgreSQL, Firebase.

2. African Skin Disease Detection System (Healthcare AI):
   A computer vision research project improving skin disease detection for African patients.
   Most medical AI is trained on lighter skin tones and performs poorly on darker skin.
   I helped address this representation gap using MedGemma and African-specific healthcare data.
   Stack: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, MedGemma, Python.

3. TweetEval NLP Classification Model (NLP):
   A three-class NLP model that classifies tweets as safe, neutral, or offensive/hate speech.
   Useful for content moderation and safer online communities.
   Stack: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, NLP, Machine Learning.

4. Christian.dev Portfolio Platform (Web Development):
   My personal portfolio showcasing my background, projects, and skills.
   Portfolio live at: https://christiandetails.vercel.app/
   Stack: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS.

HOBBIES AND INTERESTS:
Outside of coding, I enjoy reading AI research papers and experimenting with new tools and ideas.
I am passionate about football (soccer) and like staying active.
I enjoy music — it helps me focus during deep coding sessions.
I love conversations about technology, its societal impact, and how Africa can use it to leapfrog
traditional development stages.

GOALS AND VISION:
My short-term goal is to keep sharpening my AI engineering skills and ship more impactful projects.
Long-term, I want to build AI systems that make a measurable difference in healthcare and education
in Africa. I also want to grow as a researcher — publish work, collaborate internationally, and
contribute to the global AI conversation from an African perspective.
Ultimately I want to be part of the generation that proves world-class AI can be built in Africa,
for Africa and for the world.

PERSONAL VALUES:
Innovation — finding better ways rather than copying what exists.
Continuous Learning — staying curious as the technology landscape evolves.
Problem Solving — working through hard challenges systematically.
Collaboration — great work happens when people combine perspectives.
Technical Excellence — holding myself to a high standard.
Building Impactful Technology — technology as a genuine equalizer for people who need it most.

# NOTE ON THE FIX:
# qwen/qwen3.6-27b is a reasoning model — it emits a <think>...</think>
# block before its real answer. Two changes here address the root cause
# instead of only patching it after the fact:
#
# 1. max_tokens raised from 280 -> 900. At 280 tokens, the model was
#    running out of budget *while still inside <think>...</think>*,
#    so the reasoning block never closed and the real reply was never
#    written at all.
# 2. `reasoning_format="hidden"` (Groq-specific param, passed via
#    model_kwargs) asks Groq's API to strip reasoning server-side so it
#    never appears in response.content in the first place. If your
#    installed langchain-groq version doesn't forward this kwarg,
#    the clean_reply() fallback fix below still protects you.

    # parameters (not inside `model_kwargs`). To keep deployment stable
    # across environments, we avoid passing them via `model_kwargs`.
    # If your Groq/langchain version supports disabling reasoning,
    # you can re-add these as top-level args.
